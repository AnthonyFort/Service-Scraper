# Service Scraper

## Introduction

Service Scraper (currently incomplete) is intended to solve a problem that I encountered in my previous project, [CM Database](https://github.com/AnthonyFort/CM-Database-2/blob/main/README.md). CM Database is a search tool for church musicians who need to find music to perform that is related to specific bible readings or religious themes. CM Database is fully functional, but, because it relies on users inputting information about their own church music in order to acquire its data, it is not, in its early days, well-seeded.

Service Scraper fetches publicly-available information published online by other churches about the music they are performing and uses this information to seed CM Database. In so doing, CM Database will be a useful tool even before there are lots of users using it, populating it with their own data.
